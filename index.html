            How a Website can Help <em>You</em>
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            People search for goods and services everyday on the web. Why
            shouldn’t they find you? A website lets people know what you can do
            for them, and how you can help them best. Valued customers seeing
            their favorite restaurant’s menu online allows them to know the
            daily special that would go best with their meal for the day. A
            website allows your customers to see how you’ve been helping the
            community. It even let’s them know what that community thinks of
            you.
            <br />
            Maybe you don’t need a new website. Maybe all that is missing is
            being able to view your website on a mobile device comfortably. We
            make it a priority to design mobile first, going from the smallest
            screen to the TV, you will feel pride in your website once again!

                <p>
                  Meeting to discuss your new website is essential. Besides
                  getting to meet who will be working on your website, you will
                  also talk about what you expect your website to look like and
                  what the end goal of this project is.

                <p>
                  Before too much work is put into the actual creation of the
                  website, a goal should be set for the final look of the
                  website. Using Adobe XD, we will create a mockup so that you
                  have an idea of what the final product will be. During this
                  time, email communication will be common to make sure that
                  you're happy with the progress of the design.

                <hr />
                <p>
                  This phase is to make sure that your website will be appealing
                  to anyone on any browser. With the prevelance of mobile
                  devices having a truly responsive website is crucial. We do
                  our best to ensure a fluid transition between devices for
                  anyone looking at your website.

                  Don't worry about breaking the bank just to get a new website.
                  The base charge is $499.97 and that includes adding any
                  images, text, or changes made to the website. If you'd like to
                  know more, you can

                  information.
                  <br />
                  Don't worry about paying for changes after the website is
                  complete. For 90 days, all changes needed to be made to the
                  website are free. If it's a big problem, no matter how long
                  it's been we will make the necssary changes.
