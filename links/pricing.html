        The answer to how much you will spend for your new website changes
        depending on what all is needed but the base price is $499.97. This is if
        you have all the pictures, hosting, and information you want
        displayed. Below, I’ll break everything down for you.

          <h4 class="display-5">Down Payment</h4>
          <p>
            The first $99.99 is a down payment to show both parties are serious.
            This will be handled when we first meet to discuss your website,
            start working on a few mockups* of what you would like to see
            appear, and a timeline for both parties to follow. The down
            payment will only be requested if you agree to continue business
            with Sindri Websites.

        <div class="article">
          <h4 class="display-5">Final Mockup*</h4>
          <p>
            The next $199.99 will be due upon the approval of the final mockup.
            Once you’ve made sure that the desktop and mobile designs are what
            you want, we will get started on programming your website and
            getting it ready for the rest of the world to see.

            Once the website is programmed and it has been reviewed by you, we
            will give you the files to upload to your web hosting provider,
            and the last $199.99 will be paid. Two weeks after you’ve paid, we
            will continue to fix anything that we might not have caught
            originally.

          <h4 class="display-5">Images and Information</h4>
          <p>
            This will cost an additional $149.99 to gather information, take
            pictures, and help get it set up on your website. If you already
            have all this or can get this, don’t even worry about it.

          <p>
            Don’t have a domain name yet? Not a problem, this is something
            that we can figure out while we talk about your website and find
            what the best url is for you. Depending on where you obtain it
            from, you might even get a custom email along with it which looks
            even more professional for your customers. It will cost $49.99 for
            consulting on how and where to get a domain name, and any
            additional fees for obtaining it for you will be charged at it’s
            cost with an additional 20% on top.

          <h4 class="display-5">Web Hosting</h4>
          <p>
            While we don’t have servers to host your websites, we can help you
            find what would work best for you. This will cost $49.99 for
            consulting and will be used to help you decide what you need to
            help show the world your ideas. If you would like us to manage the
            hosting ourselves, it will cost the price of hosting, plus an
            additional 20%.
